-Summary of approach:
This program is taking all of the names in advertisers.txt and processing them to find potential duplicates.
The advertisers will be processed and stored in an array in the advertisers object, with a key that denotes a unique portion of the name.

For example: 
const advertisers = {
  '1800flowerscom': [ '1-800-Flowers.com', '1800Flowers.com' ],
  'penske': [ 'Penske', 'Penske System, Inc' ],
  'john_hancock': [ 'John Hancock', 'John Hancock Center' ]
}


-To run sensor.js:
Must run on a linux/unix environment where grep, wc, and /usr/share/dict/words exists.


-A few thoughts:
If I had more time, I would expand the dictionary of common proper nouns to be able to further classify whether an advertiser's name is unique.
For brevity, I've only added eight names, but more can be added to refine the output.
For example, by adding usc, meredith, and hopkins, the following seven advertisers will be categorized as unique:

USC Rossier School of Education
USC School of Social Work

Meredith Bay Sales Center
Meredith College
Meredith Corporation

Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health
Johns Hopkins University


I could also create groups and define unique names other than childrens_hospital, if advertisers with common words need to be grouped.
Lastly, I would also try and extend the program so that it could handle advertisers with names containing the character '/'.
